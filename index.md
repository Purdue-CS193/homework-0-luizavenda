# Luiza Venda's First CS193 Homework

## My Favorite Things About CS193
- It gives upperclassmen the opportunity to practice leading and teaching, reinforcing information into their brains
- It gives first-years an opportunity to learn things they wouldn't traditionally learn in CS classes
- It provides first-years with more ways to practice skills to utilize outside of the classroom
